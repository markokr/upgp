upgp - command line UI around pgcrypto
--------------------------------------

This is mainly used for pgcrypto testing, but can used
as standalone PGP/crypto tool

Note: pgcrypto is crypto module for PostgreSQL.

To build you need PostgreSQL sources, then set
variable pg_top to point there, either by
editing Makefile or giving it on command-line.
